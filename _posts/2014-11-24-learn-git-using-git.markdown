Today i create simple repository in github that contains an exercise how to learn a revision control (version control). In this case, we will learn Git basic command. I create that repository for the request in my office. I will make the presentation slides in this blog to. For now, you can only see the [repository][url]{:target="_blank"}. It is just the basic but hopefully it can help you to understand Git.

Stay tuned for the <a href="#">slides</a> !
