So, *i've been attended my english class every weeks in my office*. I really want to write something about english lesson but i'm a bit lazy. This is my first attempt to write a post about english lesson and i'm going to share about tenses. Don't be afraid, i'm just sharing **Present Perfect Tense** only. I will share other tenses later.

Did you know that *i've already used present perfect tense for two times*? Take a look at the italic sentences.

## Definition and functions

Yes, that's present perfect tense. So what is present perfect tense? Present perfect tense is a verb / tense to define the action that is already begun at the past time and still not finised yet or finished at the specific time in the past. Usually we use present perfect tense when we do not want to specify the time in sentences. It's different with past simple. Past simple usually use when the time is specific.

For example,

present perfect tense : `I have eaten my breakfast this morning`

past tense : `I ate my breakfast at 6 o'clock`

You can see the difference between those 2 sentences. present perfect tense used when we said `this morning`. It could be 6 or 7 or 8 o'clock. But past tense used when we said `6 o'clock`.

Present perfect tense can be used to describe a repetition action. The repetition action could have finished or not yet finished. For example : `I have visited Bali twice` or another example : `I have lived in Jogja for 1 year`.

You can use present perfect tense when you want to say something is just happening or just finished. For example : `John has just left his room`. I've been using past perfect tense when i built software. Mosty it will take place in the notification but it's in passive voice (<del>i will write it later</del>). For example : `The note has been removed`. But actually you can write it in active voice `You have successfully removed the note`.

## Formula

Let's talk about the formula. present perfect tense using specific formula. This is active voice formula of present perfect tense.

Positive sentence : `S + aux. verb(have/has) + Verb 3 + [O/ adverb]`

Example :

* I have eaten cleaned my room
* She has written her poem

Negative sentence : `S + aux. verb(have/has) + not + Verb 3 + [O / adverb]`

Example :

* I have not visited Mecca yet
* John have not came to the office

Positive sentence : `aux. verb(have/has) + S + Verb 3 + [O / adverb] + ?`

Example :

* Have you called your mother today?
* Has he finished the project?

So that's it. now you know when you should use perfect tense. I hope this information will help you. Cheers!
