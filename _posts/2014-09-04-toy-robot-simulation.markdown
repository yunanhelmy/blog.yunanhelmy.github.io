Two days ago, my current office held a test for all Ruby Developer. This is intended to show how good our skill on Ruby. Its about Toy Robot Simulation. Its very simple. Robot placed on 5x5 float surface. Robot can free roam around but robot must not fall. Robot can rotate left and rotate right. Robot only move straight forward. We must write code that meet requirements also test it. I will share another article about Toy Robot Simulation because there are some of my friends that haven't yet do the test and i must delete repository.

So please keep calm and be patient <del>awesome</del> ...
